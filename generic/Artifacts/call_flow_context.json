It does not assume a specific customer intent (billing vs move vs cancellation vs troubleshooting). The goal is to produce a clean, high-level map of the conversation that is stable across many client use cases.\n\nIf the call is later treated as close-ended, this skeleton becomes pass 1/2: it provides a base layout that the second pass can refine into client-specific activities.",
