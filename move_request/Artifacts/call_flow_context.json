    "detailed_intent_description": "Move requests are operational logistics: transferring service to a new address, scheduling the move date, confirming equipment requirements, and ensuring continuity (or setting clear downtime expectations). The agent’s job is to (1) confirm the customer is requesting a move/transfer, (2) authenticate, (3) collect the new address and validate serviceability, (4) confirm the move date and any installation requirements, and (5) schedule the transfer and summarize next steps (appointments, self-install vs technician, equipment needs, and what will happen on move day).\n\nA strong move call is detail-oriented and confirmation-heavy: the address is spelled out and re-confirmed, the move date/time is locked in, dependencies are explained (serviceability, install windows, equipment), and the final recap is specific enough that the customer can repeat it back.",
